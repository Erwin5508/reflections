What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

by using 'git init' you can initialize a .git folder within the directory you 
are in. In which all commits can be saved.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is used to put in evidence the files which will be part of the 
new commits. The working directory is the directory under which your source 
files are kept under git control where the .git is present. this presents an 
advantage because it allows you to select the files on which the commits will be
done.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

By adding to it from the working directory one commit at a time. And making a 
commit that you can label out of that.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

With the parent word, we realize the relation between each commit, we can see the 
'HEAD' being the tip of each branch, and how certain branches are lost.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

All of what has been added or removed combine into one single file, making it 
possible for two people working on two different parts of a project to join it 
all up. The diagram shows by the concept of parent commits it shows the 
progretion of a project.
